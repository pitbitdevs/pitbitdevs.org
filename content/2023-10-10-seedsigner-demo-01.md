### Details

Todd Blumer (and a friend) will provide a demonstration of the use of the air-gapped [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com), with open source hardware and software. We will use a software wallet to configure a multi-signature wallet and use the SeedSigner to create the keys and sign the transaction. Todd will distribute SeedQR cards for 12-word seed phrases.
